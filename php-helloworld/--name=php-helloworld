    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.3 
    ----------------------- 
    PHP 7.3 available as container is a base platform for building and running various PHP 7.3 applications and frameworks. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts.
